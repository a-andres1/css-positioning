Started by using the terminal to create my README, html, and css files.

Worked with a group to figure out whether <section> or <div> were preferable here. 

The absolute positioning was the trickiest. Once I understood how it moved in relation to the element above it, the exercise was more straightforward. 

I used code from previous work to get started on this one. Taking the containers from a previous project made this much more managable. I was most concerned about making sure the second <div> container was flush with the text to the left. This was made easier after the text and the <figure> were in the same section.
